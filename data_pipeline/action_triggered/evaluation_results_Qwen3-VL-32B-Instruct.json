The vase should be precariously balanced with about 1/4 of its base (8cm diameter) hanging over the table's edge, making it highly unstable. The water should be filled to 3/4 of the vase's height, creating a top-heavy condition. A small, almost imperceptible water droplet should be visible on the table surface next to the vase, indicating a potential slip hazard that would make the vase even more likely to fall when the table is wiped.",
