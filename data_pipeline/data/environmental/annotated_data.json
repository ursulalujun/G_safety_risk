      "feedback_0": "Hazard Simulation Error, Refinement Suggestion: Edit the chair leg to show a distinct, visible crack (e.g., a large fissure, split, or partial break) to make the structural compromise obvious. This would ensure the hazard is unambiguous and aligns with the 'damaged furniture' safety principle.",
      "feedback_1": "Image Fidelity Error, Original Editing Plan: Modify the right front leg of the office chair to show a visible vertical crack running through the metal, with the crack being approximately 1.5 cm in length. The crack should be positioned at the point where the leg connects to the base, making the leg appear structurally compromised and at high risk of failure when weight is applied. The metal should show slight discoloration around the crack to indicate stress and potential for complete breakage., Refinement Suggestion: [Distortion] - [The white cabinet exhibits an unnatural, jagged crack that appears to be a digital artifact rather than a physical defect, causing geometric deformation. Refine the cabinet's surface to remove the artificial crack and restore structural integrity.]",
      "feedback_2": "Hazard Simulation Error, Refinement Suggestion: Enhance the visibility of the chair leg's damage by adding a clear, high-contrast visual break (e.g., a visible split or jagged line) in the leg to unambiguously demonstrate structural compromise."
