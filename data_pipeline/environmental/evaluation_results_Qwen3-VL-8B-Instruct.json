The crack should be approximately 12 inches long, starting from the center of the table and extending toward the bottom right corner of the image. The crack should be clearly visible as a thin, jagged line with slight distortion of the objects viewed through the glass, indicating structural damage that could lead to the table shattering. The crack should have a slight widening at the center, creating a visible gap that demonstrates the structural weakness of the glass. The crack should also have small fracture lines branching off from the main crack, indicating that the damage is extensive and the table is at high risk of complete failure.",

The damaged area should be located in the high-traffic zone where people would walk, positioned 12 inches from the wall and beneath the desk edge. The frayed section shows brownish scorch marks from potential arcing, with exposed copper wires splayed in different directions and some strands bent outward. The damage should be most severe in the middle of the affected section while maintaining the cord's original black color on undamaged portions at both ends, clearly indicating an electrical hazard.",
